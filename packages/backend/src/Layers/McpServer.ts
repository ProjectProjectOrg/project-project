// The McpServer Layer builds:
//   1. A ManagedRuntime providing everything handlers need (Users, BetterAuth,
//      Db, ...) EXCEPT CurrentUser — that is provided per-call by the
//      dispatcher because each MCP tool invocation has its own authed user.
//   2. An SDK McpServer with every catalog tool registered.
//
// Lifetime: the runtime is acquired in a scope and disposed when the layer's
// scope ends, so a graceful server shutdown tears everything down. Defects
// from `dispose()` are caught and logged rather than turning into unhandled
// promise rejections during teardown.
